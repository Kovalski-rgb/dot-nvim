# dot-nvim
Nvim personal configs

## To install:

###### The setup script will remove all of your current config, and copy mine! Be sure that you backed everything up properly before running!
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Kovalski-rgb/dot-nvim.git
cd dot-nvim && ./setup.sh
```

### TODO list:
 - [ ] Fix Mason (its broken (again!))
 - [ ] Config lsp's go-to function inside project
 - [ ] Fix lsp auto complete on fresh install (doesn't work rn for some reason)
 - [ ] Config angular lsp to go-to function on html files
